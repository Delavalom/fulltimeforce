## Installation

### Setup

    ```

2. Install packages with pnpm

    ```
    pnpm i
    ```

3. Set up your **`.env`** file in both the two apps: frontend and server.

### Server

- Duplicate **`.env.example`** to **`.env`**.
- Sign up for a free GitHub account, create a GitHub personal access token, and store it in the **`.env`** file under **`API_KEY`**.
- Optionally, you can specify a port number under **`PORT`** in the **`.env`** file.

### Frontend

- Duplicate **`.env.example`** to **`.env`**.
- Create a GitHub repository and store the URL in the **`.env`** file under **`VITE_REPO_URL`**.
- Start your server and copy the URL, which could be localhost if you are local, and store it in the **`.env`** file under **`VITE_PUBLIC_NESTJS_SERVER`**.

### Quick start withÂ `pnpm dev`

This application uses pnpm workspace, and the scripts are set up to run both applications simultaneously. Also, when you want to deploy them, they have their own individual scripts in the root **`package.json`**.
